# Python Packet Sniffer Project

This project is a simple packet sniffer built using Python and the Scapy library. It’s designed to capture, view, and save network packets in real-time, providing a hands-on way to explore how network traffic works.

## Key Features:
- **Packet Sniffing**: Start and stop packet capture on demand, allowing you to monitor network traffic.
- **View Packets**: Check out the details of each packet captured during the session.
- **Save Packets**: Export the captured packets to a PCAP file for further analysis with tools like Wireshark.
- **User Interface**: I’ve included an ASCII art-based UI that adds some visual flair and makes navigating the tool more intuitive.

## Why I Built This:
As a college student interested in cybersecurity and networking, this project helped me dive deeper into packet analysis. It also gave me practical experience with Python threading and network programming.

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: For scripting the sniffer and managing user inputs.
- **Scapy**: For handling packet capture and processing.

This project was a great way to blend theory with practice and see networking concepts in action.
